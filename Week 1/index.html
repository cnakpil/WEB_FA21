        <li>Develop a sense of style and color so that my work doesn't look early 2000s ComicSans-esque.</li>

            <li>Or rather, learn enough so that I can do that ^^ on purpose.</li>

        <li>Acquire cool skills, maybe start looking at jquery and other customizations.</li>
        <li>If I could learn how to integrate HTML/CSS/PHP with mySQL, that'd be peak too.</li>
